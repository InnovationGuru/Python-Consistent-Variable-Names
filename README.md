# Variable Name Consistency

This script is designed to make variable names consistent in a Python file. It applies a consistent naming convention to all variable names found in the file.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository or download the `make_variable_names_consistent.py` file.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `make_variable_names_consistent.py` file is located.

4. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python make_variable_names_consistent.py
   ```

5. The script will prompt you to enter the path to the Python file you want to modify. Provide the full path to the file and press Enter.

6. The script will apply a consistent naming convention to the variable names in the specified Python file.

The default naming convention converts variable names to lowercase. You can modify the convert_to_consistent_name function in the script to implement your preferred convention.

The modified content will be written back to the original file.

7. Please make sure to create a backup of your file before running this script, as it will modify the file in place.
